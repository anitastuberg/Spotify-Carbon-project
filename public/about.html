            <h1> About the project </h1>
            <p class="text">
                The music industry has a big impact on the environment, both streaming and buying physical CDs and
                vinyls.
                This projects aim is to enlighten this in an interactive and informative way. The numbers are of course
                simplified to make
                this actually possible to make, but the message is the same.

            <h2> How did we get the numbers ?</h2>

            <p class="text">
                Calculating the exact amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from streaming or listening to music on
                Spotify can be a complex task, as it depends on various factors such as the energy efficiency of the
                data centers used by Spotify, the energy efficiency of your device, and the source of the electricity
                used in your region.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p class="text">
                To reduce your carbon footprint while streaming music, consider using energy-efficient devices,
                streaming at lower quality settings, and supporting platforms that prioritize renewable energy sources
                for their data centers.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />

            <h2> The formula used to calculate the amount </h2>
            <p class="text">
                Total Carbon Footprint = Base Carbon Footprint x (Popularity Index + 0.1) x (Song Length in minutes + 1)
            </p>
            <br />

                The project is made in the course "Self Data" at ELISAVA - Faculty of Design and Engineering of
                Barcelona.
